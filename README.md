<h1> Code In Summary</h1>
<hr>

1. The program starts by prompting the user to enter a number greater than zero.
2. An array is created with a size based on the user's input.
3. The user is asked to enter values for each element of the array.
4. The sum of all the elements in the array is calculated, and if it's less than 20, an exception is thrown.
5. The user selects a random number within the range of the array.
6. The product of the sum and the selected array element is calculated.
7. The user is prompted to enter a number to divide the product by, and the quotient is calculated.
8. If the user enters zero as the divisor, a divide-by-zero exception is caught and handled.
9. The program displays the size of the array, the numbers in the array, the sum, the product, and the quotient.
10. Exception handling is implemented to catch and display specific error messages for different types of exceptions.
11. Finally, a completion message is displayed to indicate the end of the program.
In summary, the code takes user input, performs calculations on the provided values, handles potential errors through exception handling, and outputs the results to the console.
